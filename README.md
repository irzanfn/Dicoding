    A Machine Learning Developer is an expert in using data for training models. The models are then used to automate processes such as image classification, speech recognition, and market forecasting. Often there is an amalgamation of the role of a data scientist or artificial intelligence (AI) engineer. Machine learning is a subfield of AI that focuses on analyzing data to find relationships between desired inputs and outputs. A machine learning developer must be able to come up with tailor-made solutions for each problem and achieve optimal results by carefully processing the data and selecting the best algorithm for the given context.
